The Nafsan (South Efate) DoReCo dataset was compiled by Nick Thieberger between 1997 and 2000 and further processed by the DoReCo team (in particular Laura Schleicher, Michelle Elizabeth Throssell Balagué, Ludger Paschen, and Matthew Stave) between 2019 and 2022. The files that the Nafsan (South Efate) DoReCo dataset are based on are part of a larger collection of Nick Thieberger's Nafsan (South Efate) data that is archived at Paradisec (https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/56E97595B6D0A). Nafsan (South Efate) DoReCo files with a "mc_" prefix were taken from the Multi-CAST (multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/#nafsan) collection and are additionally annotated with the GRAID (Grammatical Relations and Animacy in Discourse) and RefIND (Referent Indexing in Natural Language Discourse) annotation schemes (see https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de).
