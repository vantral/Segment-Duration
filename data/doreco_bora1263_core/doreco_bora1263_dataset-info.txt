The Bora DoReCo dataset was compiled by Frank Seifart between 2004 and 2008 and further processed by the DoReCo team (in particular Frank Seifart, Ludger Paschen, and Matthew Stave) between 2019 and 2022. The files that the Bora DoReCo dataset are based on are part of a larger collection of Frank Seifart's Bora data that is archived at TLA (https://hdl.handle.net/1839/00-0000-0000-0008-38E5-2). The files with a "mc_" prefix are based on Frank Seifart and Tai Hong's Bora Multi-CAST collection (https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/#bora), and these are additionally annotated with the GRAID (Grammatical Relations and Animacy in Discourse) and RefIND (Referent Indexing in Natural Language Discourse) annotation schemes (see https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de).
