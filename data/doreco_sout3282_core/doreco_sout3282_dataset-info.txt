The English (Southern England) DoReCo dataset was compiled by Nils Norman Schiborr based on recordings created between 1975 and 1985 and further processed by the DoReCo team (in particular Ludger Paschen and Matthew Stave) between 2019 and 2022. The files that the English (Southern England) DoReCo dataset are based on are from Nils Norman Schiborr's English (Southern England) Multi-CAST dataset (https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/#english) and they additionally annotated with the GRAID (Grammatical Relations and Animacy in Discourse) and RefIND (Referent Indexing in Natural Language Discourse) annotation schemes (see https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de).
