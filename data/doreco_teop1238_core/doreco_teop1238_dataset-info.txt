The Teop DoReCo dataset was compiled by Ulrike Mosel between 2003 and 2004 and further processed by the DoReCo team (in particular Frank Seifart, Ludger Paschen, and Matthew Stave) between 2019 and 2022. The files with a "mc_" prefix in the Teop DoReCo dataset are based on Ulrike Mosel's Teop Multi-CAST collection (https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/#teop), and these are additionally annotated with the GRAID (Grammatical Relations and Animacy in Discourse) and RefIND (Referent Indexing in Natural Language Discourse) annotation schemes (see https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de). The files that the Teop DoReCo and Multi-CAST datasets are based on are part of a larger collection of Ulrike Mosel's Teop data that is archived at TLA (https://hdl.handle.net/1839/cb80e4b8-978d-44c1-bfa3-d47bf702f8d0).
